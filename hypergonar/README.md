# hypergonar

hypergonar is a low level frame compositor that acts as a virtual camera for graphical generative
software. It aims at producing rich and high quality compositions efficiently. With a focus on
semantic inputs, bash scripting and fast QML based iterations. It's a middle ground between the
command line and a traditional editing software with a focus on scene composition and cinematic
output.
